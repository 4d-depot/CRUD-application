# 🔐 Qodly CRUD & Authentication Demo  
### A Practical Showcase of User Login and Data Management in Qodly

The **Qodly CRUD & Authentication Demo** is a lightweight but complete web application built to illustrate the fundamentals of **authentication** and **CRUD operations** using the **Qodly** low-code platform.

It serves as a clean learning resource for developers discovering Qodly or anyone needing a starting template for secure data-driven apps.

# 🎯 Purpose of the Application

Modern applications rely on two essential elements:

- **Authentication** to secure user access  
- **CRUD operations** to manage data  

This demo app brings both concepts together into a simple, understandable structure.  
The goal of the application is to provide:

- A clear example of **login** flow  
- A protected dashboard accessible only after authentication  
- A complete CRUD interface (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- A basic data display (datable/matrix) 

The application is ideal for:

- Developers new to **Qodly**  
- Teams building internal tools  
- Users learning authentication and data management  
- Anyone needing a clean boilerplate to start from  

---

# 🧩 What the App Covers

The demo is organized around two main functional areas designed to highlight the core principles of Qodly development.

---

### 🔐 1. Authentication System  
A full login flow using server-side logic.
